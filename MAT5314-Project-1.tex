\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A data set of the 2016 US election polls was given. In this project we
aim to understand the data structure by creating various visualizations.

First, we would like to give a brief introduction to the U.S. election
system as it is crucial to understand the background of the data. Voters
in each state vote to choose the President of the United States. The
candidate who wins the majority of the votes will receive all the
electoral votes in that state. Then the sum of the electoral votes in
each state is calculated. The total number of electoral votes is 538.
The candidate who wins half of the votes plus 1 will win and become the
new President of the United States. Since each state has a different
number of electoral votes, it is crucial for electors to win in several
key states. The reason is that if a candidate wins a certain state, he
will win all the electoral votes in that state. Texas, for example,
counts for 38 electoral votes during the election, it is therefore a
tight competition in states with more votes.

Analysis on poll result can be very difficult due to the fact that
carrying out a public opinion poll is generally difficult. The
experimental design plays a profound rule in these surveys, as sometimes
it is hard to achieve an unbiased sample. On the other hand, one might
not be able to obtain the final result that can be compared with the
poll result. Finally it can be very expensive to carry out a qualitative
poll under budget constrains. However, election poll result is a
desirable measurement we can study. Large institutions design the survey
and gather public opinions. Moreover, we immediately know with high
accuracy and details on who wins the election at the end. It is
therefore worthy to analyze the poll results and make some inferences,
perhaps even compare results between each election. Thus, we want to
analyze some of the key factors given by our poll result data and
compare with the actual election result for the candidate's victory.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

The data set was published by FiveThirtyEight to illustrate the
reliability and quality of each pollster to which a letter grade ranging
from A+ to D- was given. We first analyzed key individual variables in
the data, then we sought to draw conclusions on the relationship between
some of the key variables. To achieve this, we use various R packages to
present the data set and to plot the graphs.

\hypertarget{section-1-data-dictionary}{%
\section{Section 1: Data Dictionary}\label{section-1-data-dictionary}}

We first created a data variable definition table to give an initial
understanding of the data. We formed the table by collecting each
variable from the data, listed in the Variables column. We then looked
at the size and the data type of each variable to understand its nature.
An example consisting of a few variable values was given to illustrate
what the variable might look like. We then calculated the number of
unique and missing values in each variable. As one can see, there were a
few variables with high percentage of missing values, for which we have
discussed further in details in the subsequent sections. Finally, we
gave a comment for each variable to briefly explains what it means and
what it represents. The data dictionary is listed in Table 1:

Note that the poll results for Johnson and McMullin had lots of missing
values. In particular, Johnson had 33.48\% raw poll result and 33.48\%
adjusted poll result missing, and McMullin had 99.29\% and 99.29\%
missing. Due to the fact that these two candidate didn't make to the
final election, and the percentage of missing values is too high to be
considered in the analysis, we chose to ignore their data in some of the
analysis.

\hypertarget{section-2-variable-exploration}{%
\section{Section 2: Variable
Exploration}\label{section-2-variable-exploration}}

We first took an initial look at each variable.

\hypertarget{state}{%
\subsubsection{State}\label{state}}

The state variable consists of each state in the U.S., but it also
contains the national value named ``U.S.'' and some of other values like
``Maine CD-1'':

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{start-and-end-date}{%
\subsubsection{Start and End Date}\label{start-and-end-date}}

The startdate and enddate variables correspond to the dates on which the
public opinion poll was initiated and finalized respectively. Individual
pollster might start or end their poll at different date than other
pollsters.

\hypertarget{grade}{%
\subsubsection{Grade}\label{grade}}

We then took a look at the grade variable. We noticed that there are 57
pollsters (almost 30\% of the total number of pollsters) whose grades
are missing in this data set. Although the grades were missing, we could
not just omit them because there were data in other columns. For
example:

\begin{verbatim}
##         state startdate   enddate                 pollster grade samplesize

\end{verbatim}

\begin{cols}

\begin{col}{0.45\textwidth}
We suppose that there are two possible reasons for these missing data:
one is that there are some errors of data in the original file; the
other is that fivethirtyeight has not rated these pollsters yet. So we
searched online and found a more detailed and authoritative file about
the pollsters' grade from the fivethirtyeight website. Here is the link:
\url{https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/}.

\vspace{18pt}

According to the fivethirtyeight website, we found that 26 pollsters
with no grade in the origin data set actually have the grades like
``A/B'', ``B/C'', ``C/D'', ``B'', ``B-''; otherwise, the rest 31
pollsters without grades haven't been scored yet. Based on these
information, we updated the ``grade'' column of the origin data set. We
replace ``NA'' with the actual grades and none.

\vspace{18pt}

Because some pollsters are repeated in different rows of the data set,
so we want to verify that each pollster corresponds to only one kind of
grade. The result is as follow:

\begin{verbatim}
## the column of number_of_grades only contains one type of value: 1
\end{verbatim}

After cleaning the missing values for the grade variable and checked its
uniqueness for each pollster to make sure there was no error in data
entry, we plotted a pie chart to gain initial understanding of the grade
variable.

From the ``Pie Chart of Pollsters' Grades'' below, we could see that the
unrated pollsters make up the largest percentage, about 15.8\% of the
total; pollsters with grades ``B'' and ``C+'' account for the second and
third most, 12.8\% and 12.2\% respectively; ``D'' grade has the smallest
percentage of pollsters, only about 0.51\%. Besides, B-level grades,
including ``B+'', ``B'' and ``B-'', are around 34.7\%, almost one-third
of the total; C-level and A-level grades are about 21.89\% and 14.79\%
respectively. For those without explicit grades, whose grades are
``A/B'', ``B/C'' and ``C/D'', they account only for 12.24\%, ``B'' grade
pollsters make up the majority of this part especially, almost 9.69\%.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{./Figures/piechart.png}
\caption{Pollster's Grade distribution}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sample-size}{%
\subsubsection{Sample Size}\label{sample-size}}

Checking the sample size alone does not inform us much about the poll
result. Instead, we take a look at the distribution of the sample size
with regards to the grade:

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{MAT5314-Project-1_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1} \caption{Distribution of Sample Size for Grades}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-9}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
\vspace{0pt}
Here for description of Figure 2
\end{minipage}

\hypertarget{population}{%
\subsubsection{Population}\label{population}}

We now take a look at the population type for which the poll was
sampled.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./Figures/popChart.png}
\caption{Population Type with Size for Grades}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{poll-rate}{%
\subsubsection{Poll Rate}\label{poll-rate}}

We now turn our attention to the actual poll rate for each candidate.
Using the end date as the standard, we first drew a time series made of
scatter plot of the raw poll rates of the four candidates over time.

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{MAT5314-Project-1_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-12-1} \caption{Raw Poll Proportion by Time}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-12}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
\vspace{0pt}
Figure 4 indicates that Clinton and Trump’s approval ratings are significantly higher than those of Johnson and Mcmullin at the overall level. Another interesting demonstration is the divergence of support as the vote draws to a close. This shows that as the voting deadline approaches, people's intentions are more inclined to one of Clinton or Trump. Voting is more polarized. A low poll rate for one candidate also implies that other candidates may have high poll rates. This creates differences in each state.
\end{minipage}

Therefore, we try to compare each candidate's poll result in each state.
We processed the metadata by counting the polls of four candidates in
each state respectively. Result is easy to obtain by multiplying the
given sample size and proportion. Regardless of the various pollsters,
we combine the number of polls for each candidate received in each
state. In this case, we treat NA as 0.

The visualization of the poll proportion of the four candidates in each
state was presented below:

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{MAT5314-Project-1_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1} \caption{Poll Percentage by States}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-14}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
\vspace{0pt}
Figure 5 shows the poll proportions of the four candidates in each state distinguished by colors. We can clearly observe which candidate is likely to win all the electoral votes in each state, which is helpful in estimating the outcome of the presidential election. From the chart above, we conclude that Clinton and Trump are clearly ahead of Johnson and Mcmullin. 
\end{minipage}

Furthermore, Clinton is clearly ahead of Trump in California, DC,
Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Another side, in Alabama, Alaska,
Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Trump clearly leads Clinton. This helps us explore the leading
candidates in each state.

We now look at the time series of the adjusted poll proportion:

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{MAT5314-Project-1_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1} \caption{Adjusted Poll Percentage by States}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-15}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\textwidth}
\vspace{0pt}
We immediately noticed that some of the poll rate for Johnson fell below zero. 
\end{minipage}

Since the final two candidates in Election 2016 are Clinton and Trump,
we plotted box plots of the difference of their poll results, one for
the raw poll and one for the adjusted poll.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./Figures/boxchart.png}
\caption{Boxchart of Difference between Polls}
\end{figure}

We saw that there's little difference between the distribution of the
raw and the adjusted data. However, the mean of each grade of the
adjusted poll result was a little closer to zero than that of the raw
poll result. This indicated that the adjustment that FiveThirtyEight
made was an improvement because the raw poll difference of each grade
was mostly above zero, which clearly showed that the poll result was
more in favour of Clinton yet Trump was the final winner of the
election.

However, due to the fact that FiveThirtyEight's adjustment to the poll
result yields negative values, we think it is therefore unreasonable to
do such adjustment. It gives the reader a difficulty in interpreting
this adjustment.

Finally we plot the cumulative mean of the raw poll result for the final
two candidates, Trump and Clinton. We selected the Clinton and Trump
polls and ignore the other candidates' poll since the other candidates
are polling far behind Clinton and Trump.

From the plot above we see that the overal national poll result
indicates that Clinton should be the winner of the election. However,
some of the individual states resulted the opposite conclusion. It it
therefore hard to tell which candidate is leading by examining the
individual state poll result.

To make state-by-state polling results more visible, we've reflected the
candidates' polling shares on a map of the United States. In the contour
plot below, blue indicates that Clinton is polling proportionally
greater than Trump, and red indicates that Trump is polling
proportionally greater than Clinton. The darker the color, the more
overwhelming the proportions. For states that are nearly white, the
margin of victory is nearly half between Trump and Clinton.

Furthermore, we want to find out exactly the states which Clinton or
Trump captured all of the electoral votes. The visualization below shows
the net polls generated by each state for Clinton and Trump.

Based on RawPoll data, Figure 10 shows Clinton won 27 constituencies including 25 states, one additional Maine district and DC. Trump won 25 states plus one additional district in Maine and three additional districts in Nebraska. It is not difficult to see from Figure 10 that Maine and Nebraska have two and three additional electoral district respectively in addition to their own states. The candidate with the most votes in Maine and Nebraska will receive two electoral votes,

and the remaining electoral votes will be allocated to the presidential
candidate who wins each district. Moreover, DC have three electoral
votes as an independent district.

We obtained the final election result from
\url{https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president} and
compared it with our poll prediction result:

From the above plots we can see that the actual final election outcome
was almost the entire opposite to the predicted result.
