# Data_Analysis_Proj_1

This is the project aims to analyze some of the key factors given by a data set of US election poll results, and compare with the actual election result for the candidateâ€™s victory.

The project contains an original rmd file and the corresponding output file in pdf can be generated by Rstudio.

Goals:

- We first analyze key individual variables in the data, then we draw conclusions on the relationship between some of the key variables. 

- Reflect the candidates' polling shares on a map of the United States to make state-by-state polling results more visible.

Timelines:

- Project expected delivery date: October 6th 2023

- Weekly meeting at Friday night on Teams.

- Week 1: Data definition must be clearly written in a table format.

- Week 2: Visualization of relationships between variables.

- Week 3: Build map chart.

- Week 4: Formatting the result in a nice report. The format will be a template for subsequent projects.
