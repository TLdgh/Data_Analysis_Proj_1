# Introduction
A data set of the 2016 US election polls was given. In this project we aim to understand the data structure by creating various visualizations.  

# Method
We use various R packages to present the data set and to plot the graphs.
```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Result
We first take a look at the raw data set:
```{r}
ElectionPoll<-read.csv("polls_us_election_2016.csv", header = TRUE)
head(ElectionPoll)
```

As we can see, there are a few variables with missing values:
```{r}
summary(ElectionPoll)
```
